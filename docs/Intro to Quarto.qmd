# Header 1

I'm going to **bold this text** here.

And *italicize this text* here.

And do ***both to this text*** here.

Things that are nice to do in Visual mode (as opposed to Source mode)

1)  Inserting citations (and generating a bibliography)

-   This is a very important fact [@slette2019].

-   As explained by @slette2019.

2)  Inserting tables

| Col1      | Col2   | Col3   |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| element 1 | bla    | blah   |
| element 2 | lala   | lah    |
| element 3 | lalala | lahlah |

## Code chunks

```{r}
#| echo: false
x <- 4*8

height_vec <- c(5.2, 6.0, 5.7)

x

height_vec
```
